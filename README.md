# English to Hindi Translation Model

## Overview
This project implements a Transformer-based neural machine translation model for English to Hindi text translation. The model is developed from scratch using PyTorch and torchtext, leveraging core concepts of sequence-to-sequence modeling, including attention mechanisms and positional encodings.

The provided Python notebook demonstrates the complete pipeline for training and evaluating the translation model. It includes data preprocessing, vocabulary creation, model architecture implementation, training loop, and inference functionality. The notebook also utilizes the English-Hindi parallel corpus for training and testing, showcasing the practical application of the Transformer architecture in machine translation tasks.
